## Workshop 2

- Servlet vs JSP - which one is better?

- split the contents: Dynamic and Static
    - developer who do 
        - frontend - UI
        - backend - business logic
    - MVC
        - Model: data structure
            - is every Java object model?
            - ??
        - View: ui code
            - map or hashtable - key to retrieve model data
        - Controller
            - controlling actions, operations, traffic - which page to view
    - design pattern - solution to common problem
    - what does MVC solve?
        - separation of concern - is design principal
            - principal vs pattern?
            - principal is to provide a best possible design to a problem
            - pattern is how do you achieve to the principal
  - what do you use Frameworks like Spring, Struct?
    - maintenance
    - plumbing code, boilerplate code
        - code repeat over and over again
        - e.g. controller routing in servlet
    - troubleshooting is harder
- storing Session on: client Vs server
    - store on client: scalability
    - store on server: portability - if client browser send back the same cookie - it can reuse
