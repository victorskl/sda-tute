# Workshop 6 - Week 7

Patterns for Data-source Layer

- Pretty much observational on continuation of previous Workshop 5 - Week 6 on Hibernate; all about O/R mapping.
- Code are from tutorial provided `RequiredCode.zip` file; but with some modification to make it work.
- Reuse `HibernateExamples\lib` into this project classpath lib.
- Refer [HibernateExamples\README.md][1] on 
Database Development Perspective and Add **new Derby connection > New (Derby) Driver Definition** setup.

### Activity 3.2: Splitting a single object across multiple tables

- use case: for the horizontal scaling data

### Activity 3.3: One table from two or more objects

- use case: badly design table, legacy database

### Activity 4.1: Foreign key mapping - one-to-one unidirectional relationship

- use case: most cases for forward OO software modeling for data(-base) modeling


### TODO

- Activity 4.3: Foreign key mapping - creating two classes with one-to-many relationships
- Additional activity: Inheritance Mapping
