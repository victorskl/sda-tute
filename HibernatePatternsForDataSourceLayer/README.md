# Workshop 6 - Week 7

Patterns for Data-source Layer

- Pretty much observational on continuation of previous Workshop 5 - Week 6 on Hibernate; all about O/R mapping.
- Code are from tutorial provided `RequiredCode.zip` file; but with some modification to make it work.
- Reuse `HibernateExamples\lib` into this project classpath lib.
- Refer [HibernateExamples\README.md][1] on 
Database Development Perspective and Add new Derby connection > New (Derby) Driver Definition setup.
