# Workshop 4 - Week 5: Introduction to the Spring Framework

- If you are using JDK1.8 (Java version 8), you should use [Spring Framework version 4][1].
- If you want to use the workshop provided Spring 3.2.0, you have to use JDK1.7 (Java version 7).
- If these versions do not match up, you will encounter this exception:
    
    Exception in thread "main" java.lang.IllegalArgumentException
        at org.springframework.asm.ClassReader.<init>(Unknown Source)

- This `SpringDemo` project has already used [Spring 4][1].
